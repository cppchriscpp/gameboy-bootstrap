GBDK is the toolkit used to build this module. You definitely need it!

GBDK is available from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gbdk/files/

Download (or compile) the appropriate archive of binaries, and extract it to this directory.

If done properly, you should have tools/gbdk/bin/lcc(.exe) as an executable program.
