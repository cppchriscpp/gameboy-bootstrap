# GBDK

GBDK is the toolkit used to build this module. You definitely need it!

GBDK is available from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gbdk/files/

Download (or compile) the appropriate archive of binaries, and extract it to this directory. We depend on version 2.95.

If done properly, you should have tools/gbdk/bin/lcc(.exe) as an executable program.

**Note**: There _is_ a later 2.96 version of GBDK available for some Operating Systems. This version unfortunately has
some breaking changes, and is incompatible. Please be sure to use 2.95. Compilation has only been tested on Windows.

_Alternatively, you can install gbdk's binaries' to your path, and alter the "CC" variable in the makefile to use gbdk
by itself._
