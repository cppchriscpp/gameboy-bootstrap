# Gameboy Bootstrap

This is meant to be a simple starter project to help create a simple RPG-esque GameBoy game.

It was designed for use with the [Classic Game Builder](http://game-builder.cpprograms.net) on cpprograms.net.
All games created using that tool are built off of this repository, so all instructions in this document also apply. If
you are looking for the original sourcecode, it is availble on GitHub: https://github.com/cppchriscpp/gameboy-bootstrap/

This repository contains all game code, as well as some sample game data which can be used to build, test, and extend.
